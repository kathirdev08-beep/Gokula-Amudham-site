      answer: "Our ghee is crafted using time-honored traditional methods. Wholesome cow milk is collected fresh from rural farmers, naturally cultured and churned into pure butter, and then patiently simmered over controlled heat. As water evaporates and milk solids clarify, the golden aromatic ghee is gently cooled to develop its signature granular ('manal manal') texture."

      question: "Do you sell butter directly?",
      answer: "No, Gokula Amudham focuses exclusively on producing and delivering pure cow ghee. Traditional butter is an essential intermediate stage in our ghee-making craft, but we do not sell butter as a retail product."
